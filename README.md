Used compiler:

vbcc 0.9g

http://sun.hasenbraten.de/vbcc/

You´ll find a complete development environment for Windows under "Development".

Extract "vbcc.zip" to "C:\vbcc" (or whatever you want) and set the environment variable "VBCC" to the chosen path.
Copy "cygwin1.dll" from "Development" to "C:\Windows"

You´re done!
